# A-General-Constraint-for-Gaussian-Latent-Variables-in-Generative-Models

1. LDM + GReg
Model weights for the LDM+GReg: https://1drv.ms/f/c/BF9935F69E5A6A6A/IgA26Yl91LzuQY6LebRtJQPHAR7H6W2SnJFwzW6Vg-cH9Ak

The underlying Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) architecture, code, and pre-trained weights are from the official repository: https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion, consistent with the paper "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models."

2. e4e + GReg
Fine-tuned model weights for the e4e+GReg: https://1drv.ms/u/c/BF9935F69E5A6A6A/IQCZ80ES4z_nRpaVu5kOUgV0ARelMLZp4ewFx9d-n3Kg_qg

The encoder architecture (e4e) and its pre-trained weights are from the official repository: https://github.com/omertov/encoder4editing, consistent with the paper "Designing an Encoder for StyleGAN Image Manipulation."

3. Autoencoder
The design of the Autoencoder (AE) components follows the work presented in "Deep Feature Consistent Variational Autoencoder." "Deep Feature Consistent Variational Autoencoder": https://houxianxu.github.io/assets/project/dfcvae
